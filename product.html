      <h1 class="income">Our Finances</h1>
      <p class="incomep">Building a big robot with solar panels for ocean trash collection involves various expenses, including materials, labor, and equipment costs. The total cost will depend on the size and complexity of the robot, as well as the specific features and components required for effective trash collection. The cost of building a big robot with solar panels that are used to collect trash from the ocean will depend on the size and complexity of the robot. A rough estimate could be around $500,000 to $1 million. Our revenue streams include licensing the technology to other companies or organisations interested in ocean conservation, partnering with governments or non-profits to clean up specific areas of the ocean, and receiving funding for these projects, and selling the collected trash to recycling companies for processing and reuse in order to gain such finances. 
        <br><br>We can also gain a variety of grants available for projects related to environmental sustainability and ocean conservation. We get our income from supplying our Archilles to private businesses such as costal resorts whose main attraction is their pristine beaches. Due to human interferance these pristine beaches have been polluted to the point where their business has started to decline. We offer them a way to not only preserve this beuatiful coast line but also return their main attraction back to its original glory!</p>

                <h4 class="the"><b>PROBLEM</b></h4>
                <p class="bruh">The Great Pacific Garbage Patch is a massive collection of plastic and other debris that has accumulated in the Pacific Ocean. It is estimated to be twice the size of Texas and contains over 1.8 trillion pieces of plastic. 
The debris can harm marine life, as animals can become entangled in plastic or mistake it for food. This can lead to injury or death. Additionally, the debris can release harmful chemicals into the water, which can harm marine ecosystems.
 Finally, the patch can contribute to climate change, as the plastic can break down into microplastics that release greenhouse gases when exposed to sunlight. The patch continues to grow, and without action, it could have devastating effects on the environment and the economy. It is important to take steps to reduce plastic waste and prevent it from entering our oceans.

                <h4 class="the"><b>SOLUTION</b></h4>
                <p class="bruh">GPS trackers to locate the debris and to ensure that the boat is on the right path.
Sensors to detect the amount of trash collected. Using this information the robot can determine if the limit of trash capacitance has reached. If the limit has been reached then the robot will return back to the dock. The sensors also help in detecting dust on the solar panels and built in wipers will get rid of the dirt.
Our robots possess a trash compactor which increase the amount of plastic that can be collected.
Our robots are autonomous and run on solar and hydro energy. This ensures that we have a sustainable source of energy thus reducing costs of maintainance while also have a near zero carbon emmission.
Before it collects the plastic, our robot is specially designed to emit high-frequency (sonar) sound waves to deter any fishes or marine animals that could get caught in the nets.</p>

In order to gain such finances, we can also gain a variety of grants available for projects related to environmental sustainability and ocean conservation. Some potential options to explore include: <br>
1. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Marine Debris Program offers grants for projects focused on reducing marine debris.<br>
2. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) <br>
has a variety of grant programs related to environmental sustainability and pollution prevention
